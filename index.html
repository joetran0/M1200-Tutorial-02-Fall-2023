        <h1>MATH 1200 Problems, Conjectures, and Proofs (Fall 2023)</h1>

        <h2><i>Welcome to MATH 1200 Tutorial 02!</i></h2>

        <p>This page is meant for the students in my Tutorial section for MATH 1200 during the Fall 2023 semester. I will post my materials here and will also provide a summary of what was covered in each tutorial.</p>

        <h4>If Anyone Cares to Read This Section...</h4>

        <p>As a senior undergraduate, I am also happy to talk about some of my past experiences here at York University so you can get the general idea of what York is like. I am also happy to give advice on what courses you should take for your program!</p>

        <h3>Tutorial Notes and Brief Summaries</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="M1200-Tutorial 1 091023.pdf">Week 1</a> (Sept. 12, 2023): First tutorial today! We covered how to use LaTeX, which is a text editor that is used to write mathematical papers. This will be extremely important since your assignments will be submitted using LaTeX.</li>
            <li><a href="M1200-Tutorial 2 091723.pdf">Week 2</a> (Sept. 19, 2023): We had a discussion about some of the important concepts that we will be talking about throughout the entire course: Number theory! We briefly talked about divisibility and modular arithmetic. We also mention some of the equivalent ways of saying <i>a</i> divides <i>b</i></li>
            <li><a href="M1200-Tutorial 3 092423.pdf">Week 3</a> (Sept. 26, 2023):  We have worked on proving mathematical statements directly, contradiction, and contrapositive. We also had a look at tutorial activity which involves trying to find if there are any errors with the proofs, and whether the truth about the mathematical statement is true or false.</li>
            <li><a href="M1200-Tutorial 4 100323.pdf">Week 4</a> (Oct. 3, 2023): We went over the proof methods that we have discussed last week, including direct proofs, contraposition, and contradiction. We had a look at the group activity for todayâ€™s tutorial which I took up during the tutorial. I have also provided some extra practice for proof writing.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="M1200-Tutorial 4 Handout.pdf">Summary of Proof Methods</a></li>
            </ul>
            <li><a href="M1200-Tutorial 5 101723.pdf">Week 5</a> (Oct. 17, 2023): Today we covered mathematical induction and went over some examples of how we want to prove using mathematical induction.</li>
            <p style="color:red">ANNOUNCEMENT: Club Infinity will be hosting a Math 1200 Midterm Review Session on Friday, October 20, 2023 at 3:00 PM-4:30 PM in Ross North 620. There are only a number of spots for the review session, so please RSVP for the link as soon as possible if you are planning to attend, using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxkiSMDf0DTUjKSgVV93zxtLTRXLI-xVraJBqLertIwUq0kw/viewform">link</a></p>
            <li><a href="M1200-Tutorial 6 102423.pdf">Week 6</a> (Oct. 24, 2023): Today we covered complex numbers: introducing polar form, Euler's formula, and properties of complex numbers.</li>
            <li><a href="M1200-Tutorial 7 103123.pdf">Week 7</a> (Oct. 31, 2023): Today we first discussed about the oral presentation that is happening on November 14, November 21, November 28, and December 5. Please be sure to let me know which four candidate questions you would like to do by November 3, 2023, to the email <a href="mailto:jtran0@yorku.ca">jtran0@yorku.ca</a>. (See instructions handout) Today we focused on sets and set theory, having a look at some set operations, what subsets are, and some tutorial problems that go along with it.</li>

            <p style="color:red">IMPORTANT: Some students have raised some concerns about some questions being ''too easy'' or ''too short''' for a presentation to do. When selecting the questions, please do not select the following: Q9, Q15-17, Q20, Q24, Q30, Q31. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
            <li><a href="M1200-Tutorial 8 110723.pdf">Week 8</a> (Nov. 7, 2023): Today's session we had a tutorial on how to create LaTeX presentations. I have prepared a template for you to work with and an example of how it was done in today's tutorial.</li>
            <li><a href="M1200-Tutorial 9 111423.pdf">Week 9</a> (Nov. 14, 2023): We had four presentations today, and very well done to those presented today. After the presentations, we had a look at functions and some of the key properties of functions.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="M1200-Tutorial 9 Functions Exercises.pdf">Functions Practice Exercises</a></li>

            <li><a href="M1200-Tutorial 10 112123.pdf">Week 10</a> (Nov. 21, 2023): We had four presentations today, and very well done to those presented today. After the presentations, we had a look at equivalence relations, equivalence classes, and arithmetic modulo n, and we had a look at some examples of how a relation is an equivalence relation.</li>
            <li><a href="M1200-Tutorial 11 112823.pdf">Week 11</a> (Nov. 28, 2023): We had four more presentations today, and very well done to those who presented today. We had a look at the integers, specifically the greatest common divisor and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. We then had a brief look at the cardinality of sets, which we did not get to finish, but have the solutions posted in the attached file. I also have attached some practice problems for you to work on for practice, regarding (1) equivalence relations and classes, the integers, and cardinality of sets.</li>

        <h2>FINAL MESSAGE!</h2>

        <p>Thanks for being a good audience this semester! I really enjoyed teaching and being the Tutorial Leader for your 1200 section. It was a wonderful experience, especially since this is my first time being a tutorial leader, as an undergraduate.</p>
